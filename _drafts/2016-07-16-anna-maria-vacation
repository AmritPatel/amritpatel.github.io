People seem to have a love/hate relationship with family vacations. Personally, I love them. Of course there are highs and lows with every family vacation, but in the end it is *always* worth it.ands down, my favorite thing to photograph is my family. This is our third visit to Anna Maria Island, more specifically the city (town?) of Holmes Beach.
