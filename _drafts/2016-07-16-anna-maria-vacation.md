People seem to have a love/hate relationship with family vacations. Personally, I love them. Of course there are highs and lows with every family vacation, but in the end it is *always* worth it. This is our third visit to Anna Maria Island, more specifically the city (town?) of Holmes Beach.

My family is a constant source of inspiration. My favorite thing to photograph is my family. Especially my family on vacation. Everyone is happy (more or less), people let their guards down and :collision: magic just happens!

We've been on Holmes Beach three years in a row and we've decided that we already can't wait to get back so next years trip has already been booked. Spring Break 2017 here we come! This time we'll be staying in Anna Maria proper. On this part of the island (near the tip by Rod & Reel Pier), there are amazing crystal clear tide pools that form. Kids seem to love this area because they can sit, stand, and swim without crashing waves -- there are even tiny little :tropical_fish: that they can try and catch.
