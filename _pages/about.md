*Who I am*: A husband and dad of a fun-loving (he gets that from me :wink:) almost-3-year old.

*What I believe*: The moment is what matters. To see first, and only then to react. And to do so quickly. A simplified process allows me to do this with the greatest efficiency.

This process also encourages one to be deliberate and thoughtful both in the making of images, and later, in the selection of images for presentation. I find joy and delight for the final image made, but more importantly, for the opportunities to connect with others.

I aim to capture quiet fleeting moments. Family, friends, strangers. At home or in the street.

*What I do*:

  * Film 
      * Both b+w and color
      * 35mm and medium format
      * I develop b+w film
      * I make gelatin silver prints upon request
      * I scan negatives
 * Digital

> To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place. I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.
