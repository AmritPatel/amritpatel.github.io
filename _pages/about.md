## Who I am

A husband and dad of a fun-loving (he gets that from me :wink:) almost-3-year old boy.

## What I believe

The moment is what matters. To see first, and only then to react. And to do so quickly. Doing this with the greatest efficiency requires a simplification of process. I like to use simple and portable devices to achieve the desired effect.

Ultimately, this allows one more time to see and requires less time to react. This process also encourages one to be deliberate and thoughtful both in the making of images, and later, in the selection of images for presentation. It has brought me much joy and delight. Joy and delight for the final image made, but more importantly, for the opportunities to connect with others.

I aim to capture quiet fleeting moments. Family, friends, strangers. At home or in the street.

> To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place. I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.
