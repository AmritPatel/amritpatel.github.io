Starting a new project and this is the 1st finished product. Taking it all the way from image-making to print-making in my home darkroom and experimenting with cutting my own mats (check out the nifty black core!) and framing. This is also the first print where I've experimented with dodging and burning -- finally realized how important it is after reading *The Print* by Ansel Adams.

This photo is one of my favorites and comes from a series documenting the wedding day of two good friends -- Andrew + Jess. I thought I'd start with this one since it should make for a nice anniversary gift.
